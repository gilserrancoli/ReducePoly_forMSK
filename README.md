# Reduction of muscle-tendon kinematic parameterization
This repository contains the main function to reduce the polynomials used to parameterize muscle-tendon lengths and moment arms (<a href="MuscleTendonLengthParameterizationReduction">in this folder</a>), as well as the tracking simulation examples (<a href="ExampleTrackingSimulations">in this folder</a>).
The method presented here is the one published in:
